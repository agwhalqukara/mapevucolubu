<time>26 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Coming in to the 2014 Olympics, <strong>Shaun White</strong> was the odds-on favorite to win the Halfpipe competition. &nbsp;After all, he'd won gold two times already. Unfortunately, he was unable to replicate his success in Sochi, a failing which all of his competitors openly cheered about. &nbsp;Shaun White's undeniable snowboarding skill, combined with his good looks and charm, have resulted in lucrative endorsement deals that have netted him a healthy <strong>net worth of 40 million dollars</strong>. &nbsp;To the general public, he is the poster-boy for winter sports. To other snowboarders, he is the man everyone loves to hate. &nbsp;So – how did a 20-something dude from California get so good? &nbsp;More importantly, why do some people hate him for it?</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-192735 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GettyImages-160486059.jpg alt="Shaun White " width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-192735 class=wp-caption-text>Shaun White Net Worth / Doug Pensinger/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#>Shaun White</a> was born in San Diego, California on September 3, 1986.&nbsp; He was drawn to anything related to a board from an early age, and began skateboarding and snowboarding at the same time.&nbsp; During the winter, he would snowboard on Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain in New England, and also hit the slopes in the San Bernardino Mountains in California.&nbsp; Exceptional from the beginning of his snowboarding days at age six, he'd earned his first sponsorship by age seven.&nbsp; During the summer and fall, he could be found on his skateboard, turning heads at all the local skateparks in southern California.&nbsp; By his early teens, it was clear that he was no ordinary skateboarder either.&nbsp; He was taken under the wing of famed skateboarder, <a href=# title="Tony Hawk Net Worth">Tony Hawk</a>, and turned pro when he was 17.&nbsp; He began winning major titles in both skateboarding and snowboarding in the early 2000s, and his success has continued unabated until this year's Olympics.&nbsp; In 2003, he became the first person to ever medal in two different sports while competing in both the Winter and Summer X Games.</p><p>While his skateboarding career is certainly impressive, (with two Golds, two Silvers, and a Bronze at the Summer X Games), it is his snowboarding career that has made him most famous.&nbsp; The sheer number of years he has dominated the sport has made him a household name for people who might otherwise have never paid attention to snowboarding.&nbsp; His interesting looks and easy California charm have made him a favorite with talk show hosts and sports commentators, and he has become the poster child for the X Games and winter sports, in general.&nbsp; It has also made him easy to dislike.&nbsp; Like the kid who always has the right answer in class at school, Shaun White's dominance of the sport has not enamored him to his fellow competitors.&nbsp; As one snowboarder said after Shaun's fourth place finish at the 2014 Olympics, "The world now knows that there are other snowboarders besides Shaun."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-192737 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GettyImages-467796057.jpg alt="Shaun White" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-192737 class=wp-caption-text>Shaun White / Al Bello/Getty Images</p><p>His run of awards and medals is approaching ridiculous, and of late, there has been some controversy as to whether he deserved some of them.&nbsp; Even his fourth place finish at Sochi has been quietly grumbled about among other competitors.&nbsp; There is the feeling among his competition, that at this point, the judges are simply in the habit of giving him a medal.&nbsp; Over the years, he has won two Gold Medals in the Halfpipe competition at the Winter Olympics.&nbsp; He has won a medal at every Winter X Games since 2002.&nbsp; At the moment, his X Games medal count is 13 Gold medals, three silver, and two bronze, made up of a combination of Superpipe and Slopestyle wins.&nbsp; He's also won multiple Open Championships.</p><p>In a sign that he has had an impact far beyond the snowboarding community, his video game, "Shaun White: Snowboarding" was the 20th best-selling video game in the United States in 2008.&nbsp; He became the first athlete to ever win Gold medals four years in a row at the Winter X Games with his fourth consecutive Gold in 2006, and he is the only athlete to have won both a Summer and Winter Dew Cup.&nbsp; He is the first athlete to land a number of jumps, in both snowboarding and skateboarding, and he is known for improving on jumps that other skateboarders and snowboarders pioneer.&nbsp; He also has multiple lucrative endorsement deals, and his rock band, Bad Things, opened at Lalapalooza last year and just released their first album.&nbsp; So… yeah… the man might as well have a bulls' eye on his chest.</p><p>After pulling out of the Slopestyle competition at the 2014 Olympics, citing concern about the track, all of his medal hopes were pinned on the Halfpipe.&nbsp; It made sense.&nbsp; He'd dominated the competition so long, it was sort of a no-brainer that he'd do the same at Sochi.&nbsp; However, another snowboarder, known as I-Pod by the snowboarding community, landed a jump that only a few snowboarders can pull off.&nbsp; The Yolo (You Only Live Once) requires 1,440 degrees of rotation and two aerial somersaults.&nbsp; Shaun White is one of the only other athletes who can complete it.&nbsp; I-Pod, a.k.a. Iouri Podlatdtchikov – nailed it.&nbsp; Shaun White – not so much.&nbsp; With that disappointing run, Shaun's reign atop the podium ended.&nbsp; What it will mean for the rest of the snowboarding world remains to be seen.&nbsp; Will the man who has been at the head of the class move back to the front at the next major competition, or is this a sign that he is finally slowing down?&nbsp; Ask any other snowboarder out there, and all of them are hoping the answer is the latter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJopJ6dpGKBcXnMoqOloZ%2BjerS6zrCZqJmimbKzec6nnGaalajBbrTArZydZZGpta2x056qZq%2Bfp7mlew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwant-to-make-40-million-before-turning-30-grab-a-snowboard-and-hit-the-slopes-just-like-shaun-whi.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bill-nye-the-science-guy-gets-ok-from-court-to-pursue-28m-in-damages-from-disney-over-profits-from.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bill-nye-the-science-guy-gets-ok-from-court-to-pursue-28m-in-damages-from-disney-over-profits-from.html>Bill Nye The Science Guy Gets OK From Court To Pursue $28M In Damages From Disney Over Profits From</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sydney-sweeney-s-emerald-emmys-after-party-gown-was-littered-with-daring-cutouts.html>Sydney Sweeney's Emerald Emmys After-Party Gown Was Littered With Daring Cutouts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sydney-sweeney-s-emerald-emmys-after-party-gown-was-littered-with-daring-cutouts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
