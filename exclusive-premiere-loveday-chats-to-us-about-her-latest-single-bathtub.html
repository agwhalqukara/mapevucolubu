Where did the name come from?&nbsp;</h4><p>Hey! I’m 19 and I’m from Warwickshire. Loveday is my middle name, I always hated it when I was younger because it was so different, but as I grew up I realised that was actually pretty cool and decided to use it as my artist name! The name itself is Cornish I believe, given to me by my mum who’s from Cornwall.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How would you describe your latest single, ‘Bathtub’?&nbsp;</h4><p>I would describe ‘Bathtub’ as an intimate and vulnerable song. It was written about a very romantic moment I shared, it’s a little bit moody up until the end. I wanted to project this feeling of pure vulnerability, hanging up my pride and just saying ‘stay with me’.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>You have a very beautiful and unique voice. Who do you go to for inspiration?&nbsp;</h4><p>Thank you! I take a lot of inspiration from Stevie Nicks, The Japanese House, Lorde and so many more. I usually am most inspired by how the music sounds as a whole, not just vocals. I do not really think of myself as a singer, in my head,&nbsp;songwriting/singing/playing instruments/producing all merges into one thing. When it comes to singing, I do whatever feels comfortable for me or whatever sounds right in my mind at the time. I’m not a fan of vocal coaching even though it would probably help me with breathing and sounding more polished. I love the freedom of being able to do whatever I want when singing, even if I’m alone and it sounds awful!&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Did you have any other aspirations or hobbies growing up?&nbsp;</h4><p>I can’t recall ever wanting to do anything other than music. As a kid I was so mesmerised by live performances, I don’t remember ever going to a gig and not wanting to be the one on stage.?&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>You were supported by BBC Introducing with your recent single, ‘Breathless’. What was that like?&nbsp;</h4><p>It was an amazing thing for me to hear Breathless on the radio. I think the work they do at BBC Introducing is really great. It can mean so much to an artist like myself, starting off in the music industry.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>You’ve also gained support from the Chainsmokers! How does the support from big names in the industry make you feel?&nbsp;</h4><p>It was a great feeling, just that they’ve listened to the track and deemed it worthy of a repost! It can sometimes be difficult to remain optimistic as a new artist, things can tend to move really slowly sometimes, moments like this can make a&nbsp;real&nbsp;difference to the overall feel of a project. Being supported by the Chainsmokers made me more determined than ever to succeed in music.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>You’re supporting Caitlyn Scarlett at her headline show this month. What can we expect?</h4><p>Yes, so excited for this gig! I’m planning a stripped back set for this performance, just me and my lovely keyboardist performing both released and unreleased music!?&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>We expect to hear a lot more of you this year but ultimately what are your goals for 2019?&nbsp;</h4><p>My goals for this year&nbsp;are to make as much music as possible, pushing the boat out and messing around with new styles that I’m yet to discover as well as gigging more and more. I am also planning to release an EP soon! My number one goal for 2019 is to be happy, I don’t want to rush anything, I want to take my time with making/releasing music and thoroughly enjoy the ride. ?&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Do you love ‘Bathtub’ just as much as we do?
