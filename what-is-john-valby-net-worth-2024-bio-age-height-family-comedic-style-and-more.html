His music initially consisted mostly of rock and roll and honky-tonk tunes.</p><p>However, a significant turning point in his career came in May 1974 when he added some dirty songs of his own into his set. The positive response to these songs led Valby to focus more on adult material.</p><h3><span id=Rise-to-Fame-as-Dr-Dirty>Rise to Fame as Dr. Dirty</span></h3><p>Valby claimed that he was named <strong>Dr. Dirty</strong> by the National Entertainment Conference, a booking organization for the college circuit. He initially disliked the name because he felt it <strong>takes away from the element of surprise</strong>. His obscene act was partly a reaction to the Catholic repression he faced during his childhood.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u141d586388cbde8b5623eee552ad8bed><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What is Yassir Lester Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</span></a><h3><span id=Musical-Productions-and-Film-Appearance>Musical Productions and Film Appearance</span></h3><p>In addition to his blue comedy act, Valby has recorded and produced pop and rock albums for himself and other artists.
